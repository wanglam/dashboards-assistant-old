# `registerMessageParser` â€” Register your customized parser logic into Chatbot.

**Interaction** refers to a question-answer pair in Chatbot application. In most cases, an interaction consists of two messages: an `Input` message and an `Output` message. However, as the Chatbot evolves to become more powerful, it may display new messages such as visualizations, data explorers, or data grids. Therefore, it is crucial to implement a mechanism that allows other plugins to register their customized parser logic based on each interaction body.
